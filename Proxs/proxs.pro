/* PROXS - A simple shell for conversational
           expert systems with Prolog rules.

   The system uses Prolog rules for the domain, that
   are all of the form attribute(value) :- ...

   Certain attributes(value) pairs are askable, with either
   a yes/no prompt or a menu of choices.  The predicates
   ask and menuask do the asking, remembering the answers
   so they don't have to ask twice.

   It has its own 'Prolog in Prolog' interpreter, that
   makes it easy to add explanations to the system.  The
   explanations are:

	how - after a goal has been proved, how tells you how.
	why - when a question is being asked, why tells you why.
	whynot - after a goal has been proved, whynot tells
		you whynot some other goal.

   Entry points:

	load_kb(F) - Consults a knowledge base, F.
	goal(X) - Calls goal X.
	clear - Clears known facts.
	solve - Calls topgoal.
	xs_goals(L) - creates list L of valid goals.
	how_goals(L) - creates list L of valid results
		that can be queried with 'how'.
	whynot_goals(L) - creates list L of invalid
		results, that can be queried by 'whynot'.

   The calling program must provide these external predicates:

	px_write(S) - Outputs S to the user interface.
	px_clear - Clears the output display.
	px_ynprompt - Prompt user with proposed Attr:Val pair,
		getting back a yes or no (or why or quit).
	px_menuprompt - Prompt user with proposed Attr:Val pair,
		and a menu of choices.

% Prolog in Prolog for explanations.  Prolog can be written in Prolog in
% just a few lines of code, using the clause/2 predicate that finds
% clauses in the dynamic database.  This ability lets you customize the
% Prolog inference for your own purposes.

% In this case there are two modifications.  The first is to recognize two
% special 'built-in' predicates, being ask and menuask.  The second is to
% maintain a second argument which is a history list of goals called so far.
% This history list is passed to ask and menuask, so it can be displayed if
% the user asks why.

% The logic is simple.  If you want to prove a goal, use clause/2 to find a clause
% that has that goal as its head.  Take the body of that clause, which is a comma-
% delimited list of goals, and prove each of its goals.  Normal Prolog recursion
% and backtracking make this search strategy work just like Prolog, of course.

% The syntax is a bit confusing because of the ambiguous use of the comma, both
% to separate arguments and as an infix operator between the goals of
% a clause.
